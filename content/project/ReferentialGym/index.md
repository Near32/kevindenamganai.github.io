This framework provides out-of-the-box implementations of Referential Games variants in order to study the emergence of artificial languages using deep learning, relying on [PyTorch](https://www.pytorch.org). 
This framework has been in constant development since July 2019.
The following paper details its main features:

> Kevin DenamganaÃ¯ and James Alfred Walker.

## Features

<!--
+ PyTorch implementation of: [A2C](https://hackernoon.com/intuitive-rl-intro-to-advantage-actor-critic-a2c-4ff545978752),[REINFORCE](https://danielhp95.github.io/policy-gradient-algorithms-a-review),[PPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347)...
-->
+ Provides an interface for dataset to be used in the context of referential games. 
<!--
See [Adding a new dataset](docs/adding-a-new-dataset.md).
-->
+ Provides state-of-the-art language emergence algorithms based on referential game variants that can be configured at will by the users.
+ Provides common implementations of various metrics, e.g. topographic similarity as a [compositionality metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03984), [causal influence of communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05168) metric, [FactorVAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05983)'s disentanglement metric ...
