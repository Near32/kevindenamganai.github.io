Good morning (maybe?)! My name is Kevin Denamganaï, I am a PhD Student at the University of York, in the context of the [IGGI program](https://iggi.org.uk/). I am advised by [Dr James Alfred Walker](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yl5OycsAAAAJ) and [Dr Sondess Missaoui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=K2yUNQIAAAAJ).

My main research is in Language Emergence and Grounding to support cooperation, aiming to understand how compositional communication emerges and whether it can be linked to systematicity/(algebraic) generalisation abilities, and be levered towards solving the agent alignment problem.

When I am stuck in this main research, I cope by letting my curiosity loose and so I am usually inquisitive about Unsupervised Representation Learning and Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning, trying to understand more about the emergence of (situated) cooperation.
